## Lab 1: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

**Goal:** Learn how the *way* you ask matters more than *what* you ask.

### Exercise 1.1: Basic Prompt (The Wrong Way)

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Analyze this product description and suggest improvements.

Product: "Our jacket is made from high-quality materials. It's stylish and comfortable."
```

**What happens?**
- Generic, vague suggestions
- No specific direction
- Could apply to any product

---

### Exercise 1.2: Add Role + Context (Better!)

Now try this:

```
You are a senior fashion marketing strategist with 10 years of experience in premium urban brands.

Improve the following product description for a women's jacket targeting urban professionals aged 25–35. Focus on emotional appeal and lifestyle fit.

Product: "Our jacket is made from high-quality materials. It's stylish and comfortable."
```

**What changed?**
- More targeted suggestions
- Tone matches your audience
- Specific improvements

**Key Takeaway:** Give the AI a role and context.

---

### Exercise 1.3: Add Output Constraints (Even Better!)

Now add structure:

```
You are a senior fashion marketing strategist with 10 years of experience in premium urban brands.

Improve the following product description for a women's jacket targeting urban professionals aged 25–35.

Product: "Our jacket is made from high-quality materials. It's stylish and comfortable."

Return:
- 3 headline options (max 10 words each)
- 1 optimized product description (max 100 words)
- 5 SEO keywords
- 1 Instagram caption suggestion
```

**What changed?**
- Structured, actionable output
- Ready to use immediately
- Predictable format

**Key Takeaway:** Tell the AI exactly what format you want.

---

### Exercise 1.4: Few-Shot Prompting (Show Examples)

Try this approach:

```
You are a copywriter for a minimalist fashion brand.

Our brand voice is:
- "Architectural. Refined. Made for movement."
- "Less is more. Every detail counts."
- "Designed for the modern professional."

Write a product description for a black merino wool sweater in the same voice.
```

**What changed?**
- AI matches your brand voice
- Consistent tone across outputs
- Feels authentic to your brand

**Key Takeaway:** Show examples of what you want.

---

### Exercise 1.5: Temperature Settings (Bonus)

**What is Temperature?**
- Controls creativity vs. consistency
- Low (0.0–0.3): Predictable, conservative
- High (0.7–1.0): Creative, varied

**Try this experiment:**

1. Set temperature to **0.2** (if available in settings)
2. Run: "Write 3 product taglines for a luxury handbag."
3. Set temperature to **0.9**
4. Run the same prompt again

**Notice the difference?**
- Low temp = safe, professional
- High temp = bold, unexpected

**When to use which?**
- Low: Product specs, data analysis, compliance
- High: Creative campaigns, brainstorming, storytelling

---

## Lab 2: Industry Use Cases

**Goal:** Apply prompt engineering to real marketing and sales scenarios.

Choose one or more scenarios that interest you:

---

### Scenario A: Product Image Analysis

**Use Case:** Analyze which visual elements drive sales.

**Step 1:** Upload 3–5 product images (clothing, accessories, etc.)

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a retail data analyst specializing in visual merchandising.

Analyze the uploaded product images and identify:
- Dominant colors and color palettes
- Silhouette types (fitted, oversized, structured, etc.)
- Key design details (buttons, zippers, patterns, textures)
- Likely target demographic

Return results in a table format.
```

**Step 3:** Follow-up question:

```
Based on this analysis, what visual patterns might correlate with higher sales performance? What should we test in our next collection?
```

**What you're learning:** Visual analysis at scale without manual tagging.

---

### Scenario B: Competitor Analysis

**Use Case:** Understand competitor positioning from product photos.

**Step 1:** Upload competitor product images from their website

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a competitive intelligence analyst in fashion retail.

Analyze these competitor product images and identify:
- Pricing signals (luxury vs. mass market indicators)
- Trend alignment (which current trends are they following?)
- Differentiation opportunities (gaps we could exploit)
- Target audience signals

Provide 3 actionable recommendations for our product team.
```

**What you're learning:** Fast competitive research without manual review.

---

### Scenario C: Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis

**Use Case:** Extract insights from customer reviews or feedback.

**Step 1:** Upload `customer-feedback.csv` (provided)

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a customer insights analyst.

Analyze this customer feedback dataset and return:

1. Top 5 positive themes (what customers love)
2. Top 5 complaints or issues
3. Sentiment breakdown (% positive, neutral, negative)
4. Suggested product improvements (prioritized by frequency)

Format as a clear, actionable report.
```

**What you're learning:** Turn qualitative data into quantitative insights.

---

### Scenario D: Fashion Trend Forecasting

**Use Case:** Identify emerging trends before they hit mass market.

**Step 1:** Upload street-style or fashion show images

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a fashion trend forecaster with expertise in translating runway trends to commercial products.

Analyze these images and identify emerging signals:
- Color trends (specific hex codes or palettes if possible)
- Fabric and texture trends
- Silhouette and fit trends
- Accessory trends

For each trend, predict:
- Time to mass market adoption (3 months, 6 months, 12 months)
- Potential customer segments
- Price point suitability

Return as a trend report.
```

**What you're learning:** Data-driven trend analysis.

---

### Scenario E: Virtual Prototyping (Text-Based)

**Use Case:** Explore design variations quickly.

**Step 1:** Use this prompt (no upload needed):

```
You are a fashion designer specializing in outerwear.

Generate 3 detailed design variations for a women's trench coat:

1. **Minimalist Version:** Clean lines, monochrome, architectural
2. **Streetwear Version:** Oversized, utilitarian details, bold
3. **Luxury Version:** Premium fabrics, refined details, timeless

For each, describe:
- Fabric choices
- Key design details
- Color palette
- Hardware/finishing
- Target price point
- Ideal customer profile
```

**What you're learning:** Fast ideation and prototyping.

---

### Scenario F: Sales Data Analysis

**Use Case:** Analyze sales trends from CSV data.

**Step 1:** Upload `sales-data.csv` (provided)

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a sales operations analyst.

Based on the uploaded sales data, analyze:
- Top 5 performing products (by revenue and units sold)
- Geographic trends (which regions over/under-perform?)
- Seasonal patterns
- Product categories with declining sales

Suggest 3 proactive actions for distribution or inventory management.
```

**What you're learning:** Turn spreadsheets into strategic insights.

---

## Lab 3: Document Upload & RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

**Goal:** Use AI to analyze your internal documents.

### What is RAG?

**RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation**
- Upload a document
- AI reads and references it
- Responses are *grounded* in your data
- Reduces hallucination

---

### Exercise 3.1: Upload a Sales Report

**Step 1:** Upload `quarterly-sales-report.pdf` (provided)

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
Based only on the uploaded document, answer the following:

1. What were the top-performing product categories last quarter?
2. What geographic trends stand out?
3. Which customer segments showed growth vs. decline?

Cite specific data points from the report.
```

**Key difference:** The AI will reference *your* data, not make things up.

---

### Exercise 3.2: Strategic Analysis

**Step 1:** Continue with the same uploaded PDF

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are the VP of Sales reviewing this quarterly report.

Given the data in this document, suggest 3 proactive actions we should take:
- Distribution strategy changes
- Inventory adjustments
- Marketing focus shifts

For each, explain the data-driven rationale.
```

**What you're learning:** Turn reports into action plans.

---

### Exercise 3.3: Multi-Document Context (Advanced)

**Step 1:** Upload both:
- `sales-data.csv`
- `customer-feedback.csv`

**Step 2:** Use this prompt:

```
You are a business analyst.

Cross-reference the sales data and customer feedback:
- Do high-selling products have positive or negative feedback?
- Are there low-selling products with strong positive feedback? (opportunity?)
- What misalignments exist between what sells and what customers want?

Provide 3 strategic recommendations.
```

**What you're learning:** Connect multiple data sources.

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Ask the AI to "think step by step."

**Example:**

```
Analyze the uploaded product images and sales data.

Think step by step:
1. First, identify the dominant visual patterns in high-selling products
2. Then, correlate those patterns with sales performance
3. Finally, form a hypothesis about which visual elements drive sales

Explain your reasoning at each step.
```

**Why it works:** Forces structured analysis, not just pattern matching.

---

### 2. Structured JSON Output

Get machine-readable output for dashboards or databases.

**Example:**

```
Analyze this product image and return results in valid JSON format:

{
  "dominant_colors": ["color1", "color2", "color3"],
  "silhouette": "fitted | oversized | structured",
  "target_demographic": "description",
  "estimated_price_tier": "budget | mid | premium | luxury",
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0
}
```

**Why it works:** Enables automation and integration.

---

### 3. Multi-Turn Refinement

Don't accept the first answer—iterate!

**Turn 1:**
```
Write a product description for a minimalist leather tote bag.
```

**Turn 2:**
```
Make it more emotional and aspirational.
```

**Turn 3:**
```
Now shorten it to under 50 words and add a call-to-action.
```

**Why it works:** Incremental improvement, like working with a human writer.
