## Section 2: AI Foundations (15 minutes)
**Time:** 2:05–2:20 PM

### Slide 5: What is AI? (High-Level)
- Brief definition: "Artificial Intelligence"
- Types of AI:
  - Rule-based systems
  - Machine learning
  - **Generative AI** ← focus here
- Visual: AI landscape diagram

### Slide 6: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
- Definition: Models trained on vast text data to predict next words
- **Not** search engines
- **Not** databases
- **ARE** pattern recognition systems trained on text
- Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Granite

### Slide 7: How LLMs Work (Simplified)
- Visual diagram:
  - Input (prompt) → Model → Output (completion)
- **Key concept:** They predict the next "token" (word/subword)
- Trained on trillions of words from books, websites, code, etc.
- "Think autocomplete on steroids."

### Slide 8: Key LLM Concepts
- **Tokens:** Units of text (words, subwords, punctuation)
- **Context Window:** How much text the model can "remember" at once
- **Temperature:** Creativity dial (0.0 = predictable, 1.0 = creative)
- **System Prompts:** Instructions that guide model behavior

### Slide 9: What LLMs Are Good At
- Text generation (writing, summaries, drafts)
- Analysis (sentiment, themes, categorization)
- Translation and transformation
- Question answering (when grounded in data)
- Creative brainstorming

### Slide 10: What LLMs Are NOT Good At
- Factual precision (without grounding)
- Real-time data (knowledge cutoff dates)
- Math/logic (without tools)
- Consistency across sessions (unless designed for it)
- **Key takeaway:** "You bring domain expertise. AI amplifies it."

### Slide 11: Red Hat AI – Enterprise AI Done Right
- **Challenge:** Most AI = cloud, external APIs, data leaves your control
- **Solution:** Red Hat AI enables on-premises or hybrid deployment
- **Benefits:**
  - Host models in your own OpenShift cluster
  - Keep sensitive data internal
  - Control governance, compliance, security
  - Customize models for your industry
- Visual: Diagram showing cloud vs. on-prem vs. hybrid architecture

### Slide 12: Why This Matters for You
- **Control:** Your data, your models, your policies
- **Customization:** Fine-tune for textiles, fashion, your brand
- **Governance:** Meet regulatory requirements
- **Integration:** Plug into existing enterprise systems
- "AI doesn't have to mean giving up control."

## Section 3: What is Prompt Engineering? (15 minutes)
**Time:** 2:20–2:35 PM

### Slide 13: Section Divider
- **"What is Prompt Engineering?"**
- Subtitle: "The art and science of talking to AI"

### Slide 14: Prompt Engineering Defined
- **Definition:** The practice of designing inputs to get better outputs from AI
- **Why it matters:** Same model, better results—just by asking better
- **Analogy:** "Like asking a consultant a question. Vague question = vague answer."

### Slide 15: Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt (Example 1)
**Split slide:**

**Left (Bad):**
```
"Analyze this product."
```
→ Generic, vague, unhelpful output

**Right (Good):**
```
You are a retail analyst.
Analyze this jacket for:
- Target demographic
- Pricing tier signals
- Trend alignment
Return as a table.
```
→ Specific, actionable, structured output

### Slide 16: The Anatomy of a Great Prompt
**Visual breakdown:**

```
[ROLE] You are a senior marketing strategist.
[CONTEXT] Focus on premium fashion brands.
[TASK] Improve this product description.
[CONSTRAINTS] Target audience: women 25–35.
[OUTPUT FORMAT] Return 3 headlines and 1 description.
```

**Formula:** Role + Context + Task + Constraints + Format = Great Prompt

### Slide 17: Core Technique #1 – Role Prompting
- Give the AI an identity and expertise
- Examples:
  - "You are a VP of Sales..."
  - "You are a fashion trend forecaster..."
  - "You are a competitive intelligence analyst..."
- **Why it works:** Focuses the model's "knowledge" and tone

### Slide 18: Core Technique #2 – Clear Task Definition
- Be specific about what you want
- Use action verbs: analyze, summarize, compare, generate, recommend
- Avoid vague requests: "Tell me about this."
- Better: "Identify the top 3 competitive advantages of this product."

### Slide 19: Core Technique #3 – Output Constraints
- Define structure and format:
  - Bullet points
  - Tables
  - JSON
  - Word limits
  - Number of items
- **Example:** "Return exactly 5 bullet points, each under 20 words."

### Slide 20: Core Technique #4 – Few-Shot Prompting
- Show examples of what you want
- **Template:**
  ```
  Here are examples of our brand voice:
  - Example 1: "Bold. Minimal. Architectural."
  - Example 2: "Designed for movement."

  Write a description in the same style.
  ```
- **Why it works:** AI learns patterns from examples

### Slide 21: Core Technique #5 – Iterative Refinement
- **Don't accept the first answer!**
- Refine through follow-up prompts:
  - "Make it shorter."
  - "Add more emotion."
  - "Focus on sustainability."
- Think of it as a conversation, not a one-shot query

### Slide 22: Temperature Settings (Advanced)
- **What is temperature?** Creativity control knob
- **Low (0.0–0.3):** Predictable, safe, consistent
  - Use for: data analysis, compliance, factual content
- **High (0.7–1.0):** Creative, varied, bold
  - Use for: campaigns, brainstorming, storytelling
- Visual: Slider graphic showing spectrum

## Presenter Notes

### Timing Tips:
- **Build in buffer time** (don't rush)
- **Skip slides if running late** (prioritize demos and labs)
- **Extend lab time** if audience is engaged

### Common Questions to Prepare For:
1. "Can I use this with my company's proprietary data?"
   - Answer: Check your company's AI usage policy. Red Hat AI enables on-prem deployment for sensitive data.

2. "Which AI model is best?"
   - Answer: Depends on the task. GPT-4 and Claude excel at nuanced tasks; smaller models for speed/cost.

3. "How do I prevent hallucinations?"
   - Answer: Use RAG (upload documents), lower temperature, ask for citations.

4. "Is this going to replace my job?"
   - Answer: No. AI amplifies your expertise. You bring domain knowledge; AI accelerates execution.

5. "What about copyright/IP concerns?"
   - Answer: Valid concern. Use enterprise AI with proper licensing. Red Hat AI provides governance controls.
